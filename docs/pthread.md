The pthread library in C is used for creating and managing threads. The return value of a pthread function depends on the specific function being called. Here are some common return values:

1. pthread_create: This function is used to create a new thread. It returns an int value. If the thread creation is successful, it returns 0 (i.e., PTHREAD_CREATE_SUCCESS). If an error occurs during thread creation, it returns a non-zero value representing the error code.

0. pthread_join: This function is used to wait for a thread to terminate. It returns an int value. If the thread join operation is successful, it returns 0. If an error occurs, it returns a non-zero value representing the error code.

0. pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_trylock: These functions are used to acquire a mutex lock. They return an int value. If the lock acquisition is successful, they return 0. If an error occurs or the lock is already held by another thread in the case of pthread_mutex_trylock, they return a non-zero value representing the error code.

0. pthread_mutex_unlock: This function is used to release a mutex lock. It returns an int value. If the lock release is successful, it returns 0. If an error occurs, it returns a non-zero value representing the error code.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other functions available in the pthread library with their own specific return values. It's important to consult the documentation or man pages for the specific pthread function you are using to understand its return value and error handling.
